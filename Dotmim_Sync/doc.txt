dotnet add package Dotmim.Sync.SqlServer
dotnet add package Dotmim.Sync.Web.Server


The client side is pretty the same as our starter project.
We just need to:

Add a the Dotmim.Sync.Web.Client package to be able to use the WebClientOrchestrator proxy client.
Change or server provider from SqlServerProvider to WebClientOrchestrator
[Optional] : Remove our dependency to Dotmim.Sync.SqlServer since we are not using it anymore.
